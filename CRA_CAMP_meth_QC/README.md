All code and functions for processing and quality control of the methylation data in CRA and CAMP datasets

## Description of main code files

* Meffil code and html documentation for filtering some bad outlier samples, Bisulfite conversion etc. failures prior to running minfi. The meffil functions used in the R code generate the html markdowns before and after filtering
  - The shell scripts and output files from running the R code are also included with e and o extension that shows the version of run
* Other code files (with .Rnw extension) are for DNA methylation data pre-processing and betas filtering using minfi backbone. The pdf documentation was generated from these code files. Please see code file for more details on generating the documentation.
